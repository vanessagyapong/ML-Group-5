# Report on Pneumonia Detection

## Introduction

Medical practices and medical image analysis have seen a lot of significant advancements. This is due to the integration of deep learning techniques. 
There are different applications, and one of the most critical applications is the automated classification of chest X-ray images to detect pneumonia. 
With the traditional method, pneumonia diagnostic methods rely on radiologists, which can be time-consuming.

This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model to classify chest X-ray images as either normal or pneumonia-infected.
This is done by leveraging image processing techniques, feature extraction, and deep learning models. We aim to build a system that can assist medical professionals in making faster and more effective diagnoses in terms of pneumonia detection.

This report outlines the methodologies employed and analysis of the results obtained from various experiments.

## Methodology

This section outlines the steps taken in developing the pneumonia detection model, which includes the dataset, preprocessing techniques, model architecture, and training process.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this study consists of chest X-ray images categorized into two classes: normal and pneumonia-infected.
The images were sourced from an open-access medical imaging repository and were pre-processed to maintain uniform quality and standardized dimensions. 
The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure a well-balanced evaluation of model performance.

### Data Preprocessing

To improve the efficiency and accuracy of the model, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

- **Resizing**: All images were resized to a fixed dimension (224x224 pixels) to maintain consistency across the dataset.
- **Normalization**: Pixel values were scaled to a range of [0,1] to enhance model convergence.
- **Dataset Splitting**: The dataset was divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) subsets to facilitate robust model evaluation.

### Model Architecture

Several deep learning architectures were explored to classify the chest X-ray images:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: CNNs were chosen as the primary architecture due to their high efficiency in image classification tasks.
- **Pretrained Models**: Transfer learning was applied using well-established architectures such as VGG16 and ResNet50, which have demonstrated strong performance in medical image analysis.
- **Custom CNN Model**: A tailored CNN model was designed, incorporating multiple convolutional layers, batch normalization, and dropout layers to optimize feature extraction and minimize overfitting.

### Training Process

- The model was trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
- A learning rate scheduler was employed to dynamically adjust the learning rate for better convergence.
- Training was conducted for a specified number of epochs with early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- Performance was monitored using validation accuracy and loss metrics.

After training, the model was evaluated on the test set, and its performance was analyzed using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
The next section presents the results from the experiments conducted.
